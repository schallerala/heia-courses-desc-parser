Physics: a reminder of the concepts necessary for the modeling/simulation of the mechanics of rigid and deformable bodies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kinematics
    \item Amount of motion, force balance, energy conservation
    \item Friction, contact
    \item Mass-spring system, harmonic oscillator, wave equation
    \item Barycenter, Archimedes's law
\end{itemize}
Mathematics: numerical processing of ordinary differential equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explicit, implicit and symplectic numerical schemes for the Cauchy problem and their properties (stability, precision, energy conservation, ...)
    \item Finite difference method
    \item Iterative resolution of linear and non-linear systems
\end{itemize}
