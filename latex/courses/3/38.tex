Physics: a reminder of the concepts necessary for the modeling/simulation of the mechanics of rigid and deformable bodies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item kinematics
    \item amount of motion, force balance, energy conservation
    \item friction, contact
    \item mass-spring system, harmonic oscillator, wave equation
    \item barycentre, Archimedes' law
\end{itemize}
Mathematics: numerical processing of ordinary differential equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item explicit, implicit and symplectic numerical schemes for the Cauchy problem and their properties (stability, precision, energy conservation, ...)
    \item finite difference method
    \item iterative resolution of linear and non-linear systems
\end{itemize}
