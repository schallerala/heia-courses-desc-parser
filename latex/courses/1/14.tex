Systems of linear equations and matrix calculation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item n-dimensional vectors, scalar product and standard
    \item Gaussian algorithm and reduction of systems of linear equations to the stepped shape
    \item Matrix representation of a system of linear equations and matrix calculation
    \item Discussion of under-determined systems of linear equations
    \item Least squares (multi-)linear regression
\end{itemize}
Linear applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transformations of space (expansion, rotation, projections, symmetries and their compounds)
    \item Base change and passage matrix
    \item Own vectors and own values
    \item Diagonalization and applications
\end{itemize}
