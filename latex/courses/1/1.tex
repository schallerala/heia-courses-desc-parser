Introduction to Programming:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concept of computer (architecture, main components) and program
    \item Development: steps, tools used, files involved, work environment
    \item Mastering the basic functions of a development environment (editing, compiling, debugging)
    \item Concepts of type and variable; distinction between primitive type and reference type
    \item Instructional and Program Concepts
\end{itemize}
Programming in Java:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language basics, identifiers, reserved words, variables, primitive types, expressions and assignments
    \item Control structures: sequence, selection (if..else and switch instructions)
    \item Instructions it√©ratives (boucles while, do..while et for)
    \item Methods and functions (specification, implementation, use); parameter passing
    \item One- and multi-dimensional tables
    \item Creating and manipulating strings (String)
    \item Exception generation, handling and propagation
    \item Simple inputs/outputs (I/O), flow concepts, reading and writing text files
    \item Classes and objects
    \item Packages and access control
    \item Static members (fields and methods)
    \item Concept of inheritance and creation of subclasses
    \item Abstract classes and interfaces
    \item Classes internes, anonymes
    \item Expressions lambdas
    \item General
