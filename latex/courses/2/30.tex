For the semester project, teachers form groups of 3-6 people. The project generally involves the computer production of a game (e.g. card games, dots-and-boxes, naval battle...). All groups follow a common specification, which allows the modules to be exchanged and the results to be compared (e.g. the strategies of the automatic player). The subject allows developing playful, creative and competitive aspects. In addition to the two periods scheduled weekly, there are at least two other work periods taken from the student's free time.
